ansible.builtin.git module – Deploy software (or files) from git checkouts

Note

This module is part of ansible-core and included in all Ansible installations. In most cases, you can use the short module name git even without specifying the collections keyword. However, we recommend you use the Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN) ansible.builtin.git for easy linking to the module documentation and to avoid conflicting with other collections that may have the same module name.

Synopsis

    Manage git checkouts of repositories to deploy files or software.

Requirements

The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

    git>=1.7.1 (the command line tool)

Parameters

Parameter
	

Comments

accept_hostkey

boolean
	

Will ensure or not that -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no is present as an ssh option.

Be aware that this disables a protection against MITM attacks.

Those using OpenSSH >= 7.5 might want to use accept_newhostkey or set ssh_opts to StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new instead, it does not remove the MITM issue but it does restrict it to the first attempt.

Choices:

    false ← (default)

    true

accept_newhostkey

boolean

added in ansible-core 2.12
	

As of OpenSSH 7.5, -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new can be used which is safer and will only accepts host keys which are not present or are the same. If true, ensure that -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new is present as an ssh option.

Choices:

    false ← (default)

    true

archive

path
	

Specify archive file path with extension. If specified, creates an archive file of the specified format containing the tree structure for the source tree. Allowed archive formats [“zip”, “tar.gz”, “tar”, “tgz”].

This will clone and perform git archive from local directory as not all git servers support git archive.

archive_prefix

string

added in ansible-base 2.10
	

Specify a prefix to add to each file path in archive. Requires archive to be specified.

bare

boolean
	

If true, repository will be created as a bare repo, otherwise it will be a standard repo with a workspace.

Choices:

    false ← (default)

    true

clone

boolean
	

If false, do not clone the repository even if it does not exist locally.

Choices:

    false

    true ← (default)

depth

integer
	

Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number or revisions. The minimum possible value is 1, otherwise ignored. Needs git>=1.9.1 to work correctly.

dest

path / required
	

The path of where the repository should be checked out. This is equivalent to git clone [repo_url] [directory]. The repository named in repo is not appended to this path and the destination directory must be empty. This parameter is required, unless clone is set to false.

executable

path
	

Path to git executable to use. If not supplied, the normal mechanism for resolving binary paths will be used.

force

boolean
	

If true, any modified files in the working repository will be discarded. Prior to 0.7, this was always true and could not be disabled. Prior to 1.9, the default was true.

Choices:

    false ← (default)

    true

gpg_allowlist

aliases: gpg_whitelist

list / elements=string

added in Ansible 2.9
	

A list of trusted GPG fingerprints to compare to the fingerprint of the GPG-signed commit.

Only used when verify_commit=yes.

Use of this feature requires Git 2.6+ due to its reliance on git’s --raw flag to verify-commit and verify-tag.

Alias gpg_allowlist is added in version 2.17.

Alias gpg_whitelist is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.21.

Default: []

key_file

path
	

Specify an optional private key file path, on the target host, to use for the checkout.

This ensures IdentitiesOnly=yes is present in ssh_opts.

recursive

boolean
	

If false, repository will be cloned without the --recursive option, skipping sub-modules.

Choices:

    false

    true ← (default)

reference

string
	

Reference repository (see git clone --reference ...).

refspec

string
	

Add an additional refspec to be fetched. If version is set to a SHA-1 not reachable from any branch or tag, this option may be necessary to specify the ref containing the SHA-1. Uses the same syntax as the git fetch command. An example value could be “refs/meta/config”.

remote

string
	

Name of the remote.

Default: "origin"

repo

aliases: name

string / required
	

git, SSH, or HTTP(S) protocol address of the git repository.

separate_git_dir

path

added in Ansible 2.7
	

The path to place the cloned repository. If specified, Git repository can be separated from working tree.

single_branch

boolean

added in ansible-core 2.11
	

Clone only the history leading to the tip of the specified revision.

Choices:

    false ← (default)

    true

ssh_opts

string
	

Options git will pass to ssh when used as protocol, it works via git‘s GIT_SSH/GIT_SSH_COMMAND environment variables.

For older versions it appends GIT_SSH_OPTS (specific to this module) to the variables above or via a wrapper script.

Other options can add to this list, like key_file and accept_hostkey.

An example value could be -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no (although this particular option is better set by accept_hostkey).

The module ensures that BatchMode=yes is always present to avoid prompts.

track_submodules

boolean
	

If true, submodules will track the latest commit on their master branch (or other branch specified in .gitmodules). If false, submodules will be kept at the revision specified by the main project. This is equivalent to specifying the --remote flag to git submodule update.

Choices:

    false ← (default)

    true

umask

any
	

The umask to set before doing any checkouts, or any other repository maintenance.

update

boolean
	

If false, do not retrieve new revisions from the origin repository.

Operations like archive will work on the existing (old) repository and might not respond to changes to the options version or remote.

Choices:

    false

    true ← (default)

verify_commit

boolean
	

If true, when cloning or checking out a version verify the signature of a GPG signed commit. This requires git version>=2.1.0 to be installed. The commit MUST be signed and the public key MUST be present in the GPG keyring.

Choices:

    false ← (default)

    true

version

string
	

What version of the repository to check out. This can be the literal string HEAD, a branch name, a tag name. It can also be a SHA-1 hash, in which case refspec needs to be specified if the given revision is not already available.

Default: "HEAD"
Attributes

Attribute
	

Support
	

Description

check_mode
	

full
	

Can run in check_mode and return changed status prediction without modifying target, if not supported the action will be skipped.

diff_mode
	

full
	

Will return details on what has changed (or possibly needs changing in check_mode), when in diff mode

platform
	

Platform: posix
	

Target OS/families that can be operated against
Notes

Note

    If the task seems to be hanging, first verify remote host is in known_hosts. SSH will prompt user to authorize the first contact with a remote host. To avoid this prompt, one solution is to use the option accept_hostkey. Another solution is to add the remote host public key in /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts before calling the git module, with the following command: ssh-keyscan -H remote_host.com >> /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.
